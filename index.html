  <!-- Paragraph about Fake News -->
  <p>
    Those who believe they "can't" fall for fake news are usually the most susceptible towards the sensational lies. Fake news is a form of misinformation and its spread has only exponentially proliferated since the rise of technology. 
    <br>
    <br>
    At times, fake news can be spread as disinformation. This is caused when malicious actors purposefully create and share lies. Political incentives, bigotry, and click-bait revenue are all reasons why fake news is generated and shared. Social media algorithms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have been shown to be biased towards promoting fake news posts. The more sensational, the more clicks.
